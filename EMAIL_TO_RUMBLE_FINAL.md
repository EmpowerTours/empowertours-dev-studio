# Email to Rumble - Ready to Send After Testing

---

**SUBJECT:** Follow-up and Clarification - Partnership Discussion

---

Dear Rumble Inc.,

I'm writing to follow up on my email from yesterday and provide important clarification.

## I. Acknowledgment

Upon reflection, I recognize that my previous correspondence came across more aggressively than intended. While I have legitimate concerns about certain terms in the Rumble Player agreement I signed on October 3, 2025 - particularly the attorney-in-fact clause and the perpetual/irrevocable license terms added to what should have been a limited, non-exclusive arrangement - I should not have framed those concerns as legal ultimatums.

I was frustrated because I felt the agreement I signed did not match what I understood "Rumble Player" (Option 3) to mean. The description said "You retain full control and all rights," but the additional terms felt much broader than expected. That frustration led me to be overly adversarial.

## II. What I'm Actually Looking For

More than anything, I want transparency and fairness:

- **Audit access**: I'd like to understand how Net Earnings are calculated and what my content has generated. This isn't about distrust - it's about learning the business and understanding my value.

- **Clarification on terms**: The attorney-in-fact appointment concerns me under Mexican law. I'd like to discuss whether this can be addressed or clarified.

- **Partnership potential**: I believe my content has significant growth potential, and I'd like to explore whether there's a path to a deeper commercial relationship beyond standard creator terms.

## III. Demonstrating Value - Technical Capability

To show I'm serious about building value (not just making demands), I've spent the last 48 hours building something:

**Blockchain-Based Settlement Framework**

Link: https://sunny-simplicity-production.up.railway.app/

This is a voluntary, bilateral settlement/negotiation tool built on Monad blockchain that allows:

- Either party to propose terms transparently
- Escrow deposits in MON (Monad's native currency)
- Mutual acceptance with review periods
- Secure, timestamped agreement finalization
- Pull-pattern withdrawals for maximum security

**Why build this?**

1. **To show technical skills**: I'm not just a content creator - I can build blockchain infrastructure, smart contracts, and dApps
2. **To demonstrate good faith**: Instead of just making demands, I wanted to show I can create value
3. **To open dialogue**: This tool could be useful for Rumble's creator partnerships more broadly

## IV. What I'm Proposing Now

Instead of ultimatums, I'd like to open a genuine conversation:

- Can we discuss audit access to my content's performance data?
- Can we explore a creator partnership beyond standard terms?
- Would Rumble be interested in my technical capabilities (blockchain development, Web3 infrastructure)?

I'm not demanding specific amounts or threatening enforcement actions. I'm genuinely interested in finding a mutually beneficial path forward.

## V. The dApp as a Demonstration

If you're open to discussing partnership terms, the dApp I built could serve as the framework:

- Both parties could propose terms transparently
- All proposals are voluntary (either side can accept, reject, or counter-propose)
- Blockchain provides immutable record of good-faith negotiations
- No coercion, no threats - just transparent commercial dialogue

Even if we don't use it for our discussion, I wanted to show you what I can build. My value to Rumble might extend beyond video content.

## VI. Moving Forward

I understand yesterday's email may have soured the conversation. I take full responsibility for the tone.

If you're willing to engage in genuine dialogue about:

- Audit transparency
- Partnership opportunities
- My technical capabilities

I'm ready to have that conversation professionally and in good faith.

If not, I understand, and I'll continue as a standard Rumble Player creator and address my concerns about the attorney-in-fact clause through appropriate legal channels separately.

Thank you for considering this clarification.

Respectfully,

**Earvin Gallardo**
